# Dog-Breed-Classifer
We train (or fine-tune) a few different Convolutional neural network (CNN) models to classify 7
dog breeds (Bernese Mountain Dog, Border Collie, Chihuahua, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Pug, Siberian Husky). We also investigate their dataset bias and cross-dataset performances

## DataSets
We modify two different datasets: [Standard Dog Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset) and 
[Dog Breed Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eward96/dog-breed-images)

## Part 1: Simple CNN

## Part2: Resnet-18 not pre-trained

## Part3: Pretrained ResNet18, ResNet34, and ResNeXt32

## Part4: Pretrained ResNet18, ResNet34, and ResNeXt32
